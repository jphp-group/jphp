 * This interface enables testing such as:
 * <pre>
 * if (coll instanceof Unmodifiable) {
 *   coll = new ArrayList(coll);
 * }
 * // now we know coll is modifiable
 * </pre>
 * Of course all this only works if you use the Unmodifiable classes defined
 * in this library. If you use the JDK unmodifiable class via java util Collections
 * then the interface won't be there.
